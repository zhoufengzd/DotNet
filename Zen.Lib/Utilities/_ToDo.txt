Code review:
  Remove middle layer which does not really handle any complex logic

Options Versioning:

** Controllable process, consolidate with work item (backgroundworker)
ProcController.withUI (desktop / webui / flashUI)
  Button Start
  Button Stop
  etc.
  
 Plug in any IControllable object 

ProcController.WithoutUI (Main thread)
  MsgPump? So it can be hosted in a service  
  
IControllable (background or threadpool thread)
  Run
  Stop
  Pause
  
  State 
  IReport
    Statistics
    Error

** Simple process
IRunable
  Run
  
Controller:
  spawn a thread or use thread pool
  call run

Code split: keep it simple
  Simple: Assume many things work right.
  Advanced: More error tracking, control here.
    or like threading.
  
  class IssueResolverS // simple environment
  class Advanced: IssueResolverS // Focus on complicated issues.
  
Inheritance: 1~3 steps maximum.  


Threaded solution:
  Main (Master) Thread (Process main thread): sleep / wake up / check and work as needed
  Worker (Slave) Thread (Remember to set background work property)
  Communication Thread (Optional)
