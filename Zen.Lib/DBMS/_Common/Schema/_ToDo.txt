It's hard to support multiple platforms.
Keep focus on SqlServer for now.
  Though, keep an eye for Oracle.

The original intention of the code under this folder was to support multiple DBMS platform.

The code were written in .Net 1.0 time when Generics are not available.

Not quite sure if I am going to extend the code under this folder to 
replicate ChangeManger / Schema Manager stuff.

Any way, it could be used to build schema dynamically.
